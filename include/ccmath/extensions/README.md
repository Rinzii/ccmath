# CCMath Extension Headers Info

> [!CAUTION]
> The extension headers are generally experimental and could have a change to their overall API. This is generally avoided, but not guaranteed.


The extension headers in this directory are intended to provide additional functionality to the CCMath library. 
Functions here are not a part of the `<cmath>` API but provide additional functionality people may find useful in general mathematics.
