	// TODO: Implement int128_t at some point.
	// REASONING: Having access to int128_t would be extremely helpful in many cases when implementing specific
	//            algorithms such as remquo and many trigonometric functions.
	//
	// For the time being this is mega on hold, but I may return to this at some point.
	// This file is really just here to keep a reminder of the idea.
