# ccmath - A C++17 constexpr-Compatible CMath Library

ccmath is a C++17 library that provides a re-implementation of the standard `<cmath>` library with all features made `constexpr`. This enables compile-time evaluation of mathematical functions, improving performance and allowing for more efficient code in scenarios where constant expressions are required.

## Features

- **Full constexpr Compatibility**: All functions provided by ccmath are implemented as `constexpr` along with an active effort made to ensure all functions work within `static_assert`. The primary goal is to ensure every function can be evaluated at compile time.

- **Dropin Replacement for Standard Math Library**: ccmath provides a comprehensive set of mathematical functions that are 1:1 compatible with the C++ standard library `<cmath>`. The goal of ccmath is to effectively be a drop in replacement for `<cmath>` with little to no discernable difference between the two. This includes trigonometric, exponential, logarithmic, and other common mathematical operations. If `<cmath>` has it then it is likely ccmath has implemented it.

- **Performance Optimization**: Past all of the functions being able to be evaluated at compile time, ccmath was also built with speed in mind. We strive to have speeds nearly as fast as the standards implementation.

- **No External Dependencies**: ccmath has no external dependencies and only requires a C++17-compliant compiler.

## Usage

To use ccmath in your projects, simply include the ccmath.hpp header file and start using the provided functions. Here's a basic example:

```cpp

#include <ccmath/ccmath.hpp> // Monolithic header file that includes all functions. Similar to including <cmath>
#include <iostream> // For std::cout

int main() {
    constexpr double x = ccmath::sqrt(25.0);  // Compile-time evaluation of square root
    std::cout << "Square root of 25: " << x << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

## Adding ccmath to your project

ccmath has a comprehensive cmake setup and can be easily included in your project using fetchcontent like so:

```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.18)

include(FetchContent)
FetchContent_Declare(
        ccmath
        GIT_REPOSITORY https://github.com/Rinzii/ccmath.git
        GIT_TAG v0.1.0 # Replace with the version you want to use
)
FetchContent_MakeAvailable(ccmath)

target_link_libraries(main PRIVATE ccmath::ccmath)
```
